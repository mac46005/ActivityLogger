# Project Planning

# Background yo 
 Im not very tallented yet to go big but one day I will....and I will achieve my goals
 Anyways I am creating this application so that I can take breaks in between studying and
 my mental well being. I wanna keep track of what activites I do and the times it takes.

 # The Real use  
 Ok so for now I want this app to be able to set times for certain activites
 Say your studying you need breaks here and there and I tend to just study the whole time
  so I want to implement a timer for study time and break times so that I can make sure I can 
  take breaks from time to time and have healthy study habbits. Maybe log everything i do so that it reminds me of the tasks that i have done that day. IDK something like that
# Technologies to use 
- WPF
- Microsoft SQL
- C#

# Run down  
1. Create Activity
2. Start Activity
3. Log Activity

# CLASSES  
**Activity**
In this object there should be options of time cycles. 
The time cycles are in charge of tracking the amount of time your doing this particular activity 
and for how long this activity should run for then you have the option to set for how long and how long a break should be for.

Once it instantiates a timer is set and you can log what you are doing after every break

A timer can be viewed and will set the alarm when break is needed and when break is over.
